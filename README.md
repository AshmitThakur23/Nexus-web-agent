# Nexus-Web-Agent

## How to run locally

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Firebase configuration values
2. Enable Google & Email/Password authentication in your Firebase console
3. Run the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Test Authentication

1. Go to `/auth`
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Allow permissions
4. Should redirect to `/`

## Security Notes

**Do NOT commit `.env.local`.** The Firebase API key is safe to be public for client usage, but keep other credentials secret. Use Firebase rules for database security.
